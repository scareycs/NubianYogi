                  <p>Yoga is designed to take people on an inward journey, exploring all of the idiosyncrasies that make us unique beings. Things that have developed within us over a lifetime, and now no longer serve a beneficial purpose to our spirit, can be released. First, you must take inventory of all features within.</p>
                  <p>Then, you must do the analysis to determine if the characteristics are beneficial for you at this particular stage on your journey. Yoga is a great mechanism to facilitate this exploration. While taking this deep examination of your inner self, you will discover positive qualities that have been within you the entire time however, they have been virtually untapped or dormant.</p>
              </div>


              <div class="col-4 content2">
                  <p>Your life can change dramatically once you reawaken those positive traits within. You will start to become the person you always knew you could be, viewing the world from an entirely new lens. Your creativity will increase, while your frustration decreases. You will begin to accomplish things you previously thought were beyond your grasp.</p>

    <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300/?random" class="aboutImage" alt-"random image">
     <p>The Nubian Yogi currently teaches Vinyasa and Yen yoga classes in Washington D.C.. He teaches at Embrace Studio and has led classes in such venues as the John F. Kennedy Center, the United States State Department and others. He teaches private classes and groups of any size.</p>

    <p>The Nubian Yogi first began his yoga journey in 2006. After experiencing emotional trauma from losing his home, two cars, and most of his family possessions as a result of Hurricane Katrina, he decided to try some yoga classes at their local YMCA.</p>

    <p>It was in this class that The Nubian Yogi met an elderly gentleman that would forever change his outlook on life. This gentlemen stated that he had buried all of his friends and that the only lifestyle difference between him and his friends was Yoga. Ever since that moment, The Nubian Yogi has been a consistent practitioner.</p>

    <p>In 2015, his journey brought him to Embrace Studio in Washington DC, where he decided to take a training course under tutelage of the incomparable Faith Hunter. He originally enrolled so that he could deepen his own practice; however, Faith asked him to teach a weekly class that he still teaches to this date. He also currently continues his education at Embrace Studio.</p>
