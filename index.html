            <p>Yoga is designed to take people on an inward journey, exploring all of the idiosyncrasies that make us
        unique beings. Things that have developed within us over a lifetime, and now no longer serve a
        beneficial purpose to our spirit, can be released. First, you must take inventory of all features within.
        Then, you must do the analysis <span id="dots">...</span><div id="more"> to determine if the characteristics are beneficial for you at this particular
        stage on your journey. Yoga is a great mechanism to facilitate this exploration. While taking this deep
        examination of your inner self, you will discover positive qualities that have been within you the entire
        time however, they have been virtually untapped or dormant.</p>

        <p>Your life can change dramatically once you reawaken those positive traits within. You will start to
        become the person you always knew you could be, viewing the world from an entirely new lens. Your
        creativity will increase, while your frustration decreases. You will begin to accomplish things you
          previously thought were beyond your grasp.</p></div>

          <div class="areaTitle">Balance</div>
          <div class="areaContent">
            <p>Balance is such an important part of our journey. Whether it is the equilibrium of chakras or adding some diversity to your physical workouts, yoga is an excellent tool. As we or our loved ones age, balancing becomes more important and yet more difficult.  A regular yoga practice will ease some of the difficulty.<span id="dots">...</span><div id="more"></p>

      <p>On our journey, sometimes our energy centers (also known as chakras) become unbalanced. This generally manifest itself in our physical world through stagnation, agitation, discontentment, disease etc.... A consistent yoga practice can be the avenue to realign the chakra balance necessary for one to live a happier, healthier life.</p>

      <p>If you have a regular workout routine that is becoming boring or stale, yoga could be the added mix needed to provide some variety and keep the body in motion.</p>

      <p>As we age, our bones no longer heal as fast as they once did. Falling can not only lead to extended recovery time, but also lead to some severely damaged internal organs. A consistent yoga practice will increase ones equilibrium to the point that falling becomes an unlikely occurrence.</p>

          <div class="areaTitle">Social Justice</div>
          <div class="areaContent">
            <p>Social Justice is one of The Nubian Yogi’s most passionate areas. He has a natural aptitude for combining socially conscious musical soundtracks with spirit awakening yoga sequences. You can raise the conscious awareness of your corporate culture, staff or individuals, while also promoting a physical healthy lifestyle.</p>

      <p>The Nubian Yogi honed this unique talent while pursuing his Master’s Degree from Southern University in the discipline of Mass Communication, with an emphasis on the Socialization Effect of Media Images. This awakened him to the power of intention.</p>

      <p>He has facilitated Conversations on Race : professional development seminars for educators at the National Museum for African American History and Culture.</p>

      <p>He can provide 3-day workshops, integrating yoga with Racial Education, or you can sign your organization up for a one-time social justice yoga session.  The Nubian Yogi regularly conducts his social justice yoga at the John F Kennedy Center and the nostalgic Potter’s House Restaurant in Washington, DC.</p>

              <p>The Nubian Yogi was Coach Perry Daniels for several years, coaching football and basketball for various
          schools for the Louisiana High School Athletic Association and for the Prince George’s County, Maryland
          system.</p>

      <p>He has coached high profile athletes such as</p>

      <p>and Chad Williams (Arizona Cardinals, WR)</p>

      <p>Yoga works well for athletes as an integral part of their conditioning program by increasing focus and flexibility while simultaneously expanding lung capacity.</p>

      <p>“From my experience, It is important to keep athletes healthy and
          their bodies ready to play in order for them to perform at their
          highest levels” – The Nubian Yogi</p>

      <p>The Nubian Yogi can design tailored yoga routines for your team or an individual athlete</p>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300/?random" class="secImage" alt-"random image">
       <p>The Nubian Yogi currently teaches Vinyasa and Yen yoga classes in Washington D.C.. He teaches at Embrace Studio and has led classes in such venues as the John F. Kennedy Center, the United States State Department and others. He teaches private classes and groups of any size.</p>

      <p>The Nubian Yogi first began his yoga journey in 2006. After experiencing emotional trauma from losing his home, two cars, and most of his family possessions as a result of Hurricane Katrina, he decided to try some yoga classes at their local YMCA.</p>

      <p>It was in this class that The Nubian Yogi met an elderly gentleman that would forever change his outlook on life. This gentlemen stated that he had buried all of his friends and that the only lifestyle difference between him and his friends was Yoga. Ever since that moment, The Nubian Yogi has been a consistent practitioner.</p>

      <p>In 2015, his journey brought him to Embrace Studio in Washington DC, where he decided to take a training course under tutelage of the incomparable Faith Hunter. He originally enrolled so that he could deepen his own practice; however, Faith asked him to teach a weekly class that he still teaches to this date. He also currently continues his education at Embrace Studio.</p>
